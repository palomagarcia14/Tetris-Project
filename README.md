# As commented throughout our code, we spent a considerable amount of time trying to create the game tetris. We ran into a lot of trouble because we did 
# not have a very full understanding of classes and objects in python, specifically how they work together and can be called by each other. While welearned
# a lot, this slowed our team down and we were not able to code a functional tetris game. However, we were able to pivot our work to be applicable to a 
# different game that used many of the same functions that we had orginally created for tetris. This was fortunate because a lot of the time we spent 
# researching could actually be used in our final game, even though it wasn't tetris.
